It was time to start writing more regularly again and so here we are. Updates are likely to be occasional and varied whilst I find my feet.

I used to blog a lot in the past, but that goes back a few years. Like a lot of people my words started to exist only on social media. Recently I've had the desire to write more longform words, and also to keep them somewhere under my control.

One of the ways that this blog will be different is that I'm not using Wordpress for the first time in a while. The site is hosted using the Gatsby.js system and hosted on Netlify. Gatsby is a flat-file generator so there's no database to manage. It should also be faster but for a blog like this it's not an important reason. The content is synced to Github and then Netlify builds a fresh copy of the site each time I store a new post and commit it. A nice lightweight experience, plus my recent experience of React means that I'll be more comfortable making theme changes than Wordpress' convoluted PHP / hook system.
